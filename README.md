# Undergraduate-Project-II
The Repository contains the work done by me in the Undergraduate Project during the Even Semester 2022-23.



During my UGP I worked on understanding and implementing Discrete Element Methods to simulate the motion of Non-Spherical Particles using the Multisphere Model. I also examined the codes of various Open Source Software such as LIGGGHTS and MUSEN. The final Simulation results were animated using GNUPlot.
